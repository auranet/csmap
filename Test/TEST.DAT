#       Each line represents a coordinate conversion
#       test.  The first three and the second three
#       elements represent a location.  The first
#       element of each location is the coordinate
#       system name.  The second is the X coordinate
#       or longitude, the third element is the Y
#       coordinate or latitude.
#
#       Each test consists of converting the first
#       location to the coordinate system of the
#       second and comparing the results.  The last
#       two elements are the X and Y tolerance of
#       the comparison.
#
#       Each test is based on information obtained from reputable
#       sources external to Mentor Software. The accuracy of these
#       various sources is not always known. Therefore, the
#       tolerances should not be interpreted as an indication of the
#       accuracy or precision of the Coordinate System Mapping
#       Package, but more as an indication of the accuracy of the
#       source.
#
#       Especially true in the case of inverse calculations, the
#       precision of the input numbers, usually truncated to six
#       decimal places can leave an output significantly off
#       from what is expected.
#
#       No test for the Equidistant Cylindrical projection is provided
#       as I have not found any data from an independent source for
#       this projection.
#
#  The following tests were verified using CORPSCON. Note, that
#  CS_MAP uses a more accurate meridinal arc calculation then
#  does CORPSCON. Therefore, variations as much as a millimeter
#  can be expected in the higher latitudes.

# The tolerances are very high on this one, probably due to
# the fact that it is a sphere only, and the projection is
# used only for one specific coordinate system, used to place
# both North and South America on a single map.  Thus, Synder
# probably didn't get very serious about precision.  The accuracy
# of the projeciton has been verified by comparing the inverse and
# the forward, and these compare very well.

#  The following test the Canadian National Transformation, versions 1 & 2.
#  The test data was obtained from the actual INTGRID program, Canada's
#  version of NADCON.  If the Canadian data file is not present, these
#  conversions will fail.  Mentor Software is not permitted to distribute
#  either data file.  You must obtain such from the Canadian government or
#  one of the provincial governments.  I think they want to keep track of
#  who is using the data file.
#
#  Since I can't distribute the file, I have commented out these
#  tests so the failure will not show up under normal testing
#  (normal in this case means without either Canadian data file).

# The following tests were generated using the INTGRID program. The values
# were chosen to test the proper operation of CS-MAP in the two regions
# where the data file is not according to the specification. The first four
# tests are necessary to set up the specific condition which would cause
# releases of CS-MAP prior to 8.0 to fail.

# The following test was extracted from the GDAit Software Documentation
# manual, supplied with the GDAit application.  This is used to test
# the implmentation of the Geocentric Datum of Australia of 1994.
#
# The tolerance values here are somewhat large.  This is necessary, I think,
# as the document was written using the original data file.  Note, the similar
# test case below generated with the latest file.
#
# The following tests have been upgraded to jive with the new Australian National data
# files.  In the past, the AUstralian continent was covered by several overlapping
# files; three or four for each of the two datums.  This condition being the reason
# for the implementation of the .gdc file concept.
#
# With the 11.05 distribution, CS-MAP now distributes the new National datum shift
# files where there are only two files, one for each datum (AGD66 and AGD84) and
# where each file covers the entire continent (no overlaps).
#
# Of course, the numbers are not the same with the new files.  So the test results
# given here had to change.  Also, the new files have different boundaries, and
# different densities.  They are both fully compliant with the Canadian NTv2 standard.
# Thus not only did some of the result values change, the original test values also
# had to change in order to transfer the specific condition being tested into the
# new environment.

# The following test the Seven Parameter datum transformation.
# The test data/results were obtained from the following
# Web site:
#	http://www.swisstopo.ch/de/geo/navref.htm
# This reference only produces linear values to a meter, and
# geographic values to a tenth of a second.  Also, note that
# the calculator at this site is not very good at reversing a
# calculation.  Thus, the algorithm's accuracy is suspect.
# Thus, to test reversibility, we use geographic values
# calculated by CS-MAP from the cartesian test values.
#
# The tests below with the rather high tolerance values are
# the exact numbers obtained from the above referenced site.
# The tests with the rather low tolerance numbers were generated
# by CS-MAP.
#
# In release 10, a coding error was corrected in the 7 parameter
# transformation.  The error introduced by this coding error, as
# determined by the following tests, is on the order of 4 millimeters
# maximum.  Thus, Mentor Software considers this error to be insignificant.
# Therefore, those tests where the tolerances are at the millimeter
# level had to be adjusted slightly to pass muster.

# The above tests are designed to test the integrity of the projection
# and datum conversion software.  The following tests are designed to
# test the definitions of specific coordinate systems.  Therefore, only
# the Inverse direction is tested.  We should also add some test for
# the definitions of datums.  Note, however, that the Multiple Regression
# compiler has a built in test for all of those definitions.
#

#
#  UNLIKE ALL OF THE NUMBERS IN THE TESTS ABOVE, THE TESTS GIVEN BELOW
#  HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED AGAINST A SOURCE OUTSIDE OF MENTOR SOFTWARE.
#  THEREFORE, NO GUARANTEE EXISTS THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT.

# The Krovak system.  These test were provided by a client, who in turn obtained
# them from a reliable source in the Czech Republic.
#
# In release 11.14, the axix swap was removed from the Krovak projection per
# suggestion by Czeck users.  These tests have, therefore, been modified to
# reflect this change.  ALso in 11.14, the Krovak/95 projection has been
# deprecated, again per suggestion from Czech users, as it seems that
# algorithm is not really used by anyone.  The test remain, however, as
# a reasonably good check on the implementation of the Krovak projection.

# The following six tests (3 test cases, fwd and inv), were extracted from a document
# titled A Recomputation of the Transformation between Ireland75 and ETRF89", subtitled
# "PHI75 User's Guide and Software Developer's Notes."  This document actually has the
# multiple regression coefficients in it.  As you can see, we match these numbers fairly
# well, i.e. plus or minus a couple of millimeters.

# The following test came from and Excel spreadsheet provided by th OSI/OSNI.  We don't
# match these numbers quite so well.  Since intermediary lat/longs are not provided,
# we can't tell if the problem is in the datum shift or the Irish Grid projection
# calculations.  COuld it be that these values are actual measured values as
# opposed to values calculated by some program?????

# The following results were obtained using NbGeoCalc (ala Guy LeBlanc,

# Since these tests require access to files which Mentor cannot distribute,
# the tests are commented out.

# For the following eight tests, the files required are:  TRNB2777.dat,

# are the correpsonding files for Prince Edward Island, but Mentor doesn't

# NBGeoCalc, version 3.0.  In addition to the test above, we include below a test
# of the conversion of LL27 to CSRS.  This conversion is not expicitly supported

# The folloowing test points are from Instituto Geogrfico Nacional, Spain
# Very precise and accirate.  Evidently, they were generated by the SPanish
# version of the Candian INTGRID and Australian GDAit programs.
#
# Note, there is an older SPanish .GSB file (a single gird) and a newer Spanish
# .GSB file that has two overlapping grids.  This test data set was generated
# using the newer .GSB file (circa 2005).

# Iceland Grid tests.
#
# In the two older Icelandic grids, Eastings are defined to increase to the
# west.  THis means any map made with that coordinate system would be mirrored
# and look awfully funny.  Thus, the CS-MAP implementation inverts the sign of
# the easting so that the absolute value is the expected coordinate value,
# but eastings increase to the east and thus provide for a map that looks
# correct in thetypical GIS/CAD/Mapping application.
